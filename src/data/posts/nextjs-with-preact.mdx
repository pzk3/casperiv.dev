## Getting Started

This blog post will explain how you can easily add [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) to your Next.js application to reduce Next.js' bundle size.

<Info style={{ margin: "1rem 0" }}>
  **Note:** Some features in React.js that are not yet supported in Preact, This [may break some parts in
  your Next.js
  application](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/863#issuecomment-963031570).
</Info>

### Preact installation

Preact can be easily installed with the following command:

```bash --command=true
npm install preact
```

### Next.js configuration

To enable Preact, we must edit our [Next config](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction).

```js title="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
    // Note, preact is only enabled for production builds (`next build`)
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      config.resolve.alias = {
        ...config.resolve.alias,
        "react/jsx-runtime.js": "preact/compat/jsx-runtime",
        react: "preact/compat",
        "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
        "react-dom": "preact/compat",
      };
    }

    return config;
  },
};
```

### Usage

Once you build your Next.js application, you should see a decrease in bundle size.
Below you can see the results on my site.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center flex-col md:flex-row gap-3 -mt-5">
  <figure>
    <Image
      width={618.7}
      height={494}
      alt="Without Preact"
      src="/blog/nextjs-with-preact/without-preact.png"
      blurDataURL={WithPreact}
    />
    <figcaption>Without Preact</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <Image
      width={618.7}
      height={494}
      alt="With Preact"
      src="/blog/nextjs-with-preact/with-preact.png"
      blurDataURL={WithPreact}
    />
    <figcaption>With Preact</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

### That's it

Yes, that's it! It's super easy 🚀!
