# Getting started

<Alert type="warn">
  SnailyCADv3 will be archived on `2021-12-31`. SnailyCADv4 is currently in stable beta and ready to
  be used! [Check SnailyCADv4 out here](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4)
</Alert>

This is a Windows guide for installing SnailyCAD. You [can view the Linux (Ubuntu) guide here](/blog/setting-up-snailycad-linux).

## Requirements

Before starting the installation of SnailyCAD, you need to have the follow installed on your machine:

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJS v14](https://nodejs.org) (**Must be v14 or you'll run into problems!**)
- [MySQL](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

## Setting up XAMPP

**If you already have XAMPP setup or another MySQL database, you can skip to [Installing SnailyCAD](#installing-snailycad).**

After successfully installing XAMPP, open the XAMPP Control Panel

You should see something like this:

<Image
  width={1333}
  height={684}
  src="/blog/xampp-control-panel.png"
  alt="xampp-control-panel"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={XamppControlPanel}
/>

Now we'll start both `Apache` and `MySQL` by clicking the `Start` button.

If started successfully, you can now access [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin) in your browser

---

Let's create the database and insert the `snaily-cad.sql` file

In the sidebar you can see a link: "New", click that, it should look something like this:

<Image
  width={847}
  height={469}
  alt="create-database"
  src="/blog/create-database.png"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={CreateDB}
/>

Enter `snaily-cad` in the input field then click `Create`.

Once finished creating the database, you can should see a navbar at the top, click the `import` button:

<Image
  width={1587}
  height={83}
  alt="import-button"
  src="/blog/import-button.png"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={ImportButton}
/>

Now a new window should appear, click the `browse...` button and select the `snaily-cad.sql` file. It's located in the root folder of SnailyCAD. After selecting it you can click the `Go` button on the bottom right corner.

  alt="database-browse"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={DatabaseBrowse}
/>

🎉 You've successfully setup XAMPP and MySQL for SnailyCAD! If you're experiencing issues, [feel free

## Installing SnailyCAD

Firstly, [open your command prompt](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/)

Once opened, we'll need to clone down the code, run the following command:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost/snaily-cadv3
```

Once that's finished, we can go into the SnailyCAD folder with the following command:

```console
cd snaily-cadv3
```

Now we need to install all the dependencies to run the CAD. Run the following command:

_This can take several minutes to finish, please be patient!_

```console
npm install
```

Once it has finished installing, you [can open windows file explorer](https://www.howtogeek.com/693474/12-ways-to-open-file-explorer-in-windows-10/) and navigate to the folder where you installed SnailyCAD. (Keep the command prompt open)

Now you should see the following files and folders:

<Image
  width={1360}
  height={978}
  alt="snaily-cad-root-folder"
  src="/blog/snaily-cad-root-folder.png"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={CadRootFolder}
/>

If you don't see the file extensions (`.js`, `.md`, `.sql`, ...) I [recommend enabling this](https://www.msftnext.com/show-file-extensions-windows-10-explorer/)

---

Now navigate into the `src` folder and look for the `config.example.ts` file. **Copy and rename** this file to `config.ts`.

Your server folder should look like this now:

<Image
  width={1102}
  height={433}
  src="/blog/server-folder-config.png"
  alt="server-folder-config"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={ServerConfig}
/>

Now open the `config.ts` file with `notepad` or any other text-editor. You can [view more information about what the values mean here](https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost/snaily-cadv3/wiki/Config-file).

Once modified, make sure to save the config file (CTRL + S).

Now you can go back to your command prompt from earlier and run the following command:

```console
npm start
```

This will start SnailyCAD.

## Woohoo 🎉🎉

You've successfully installed SnailyCAD!

You can now open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) in your browser.
