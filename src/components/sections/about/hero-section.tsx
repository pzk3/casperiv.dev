            Hey there! {"Let's"} get straight to it! {"I'm"} Casper, a motivated web developer and
            student based in Belgium. I am an 18-year-old developer building cutting-edge web
            applications using the latest technologies such as React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and
            much more for {formattedStartDate} now.
          </p>

            I started back when I was a 14-year-old kid that had an extreme passion for creating
            stuff, building simple static web pages and expanding my CSS knowledge by recreating
            awesome designs. {"I've"} continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
            challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            When {"I'm"} not in full-on developer mode, you will find me blasting down a dirt track
            or the streets of my city. {"There's"} nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline that
            comes from going ultra-fast, and for me, {"there's"} no better way to experience that
            than on my trusty mountain bike. I also have a deep appreciation for music, listening to
            a wide range of genres that I thoroughly enjoy.
